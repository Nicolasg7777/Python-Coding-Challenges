# Control Flow Challenges

This folder contains Python challenges focused on **control flow** - learning how to use `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to make decisions in your code.

## Challenges

### 1. 🎒 High School Grades (EASY - 5 XP)
**File:** `01_high_school_grades.py`

Learn how to use if/elif/else statements to classify high school grade levels (9-12 as Freshman-Senior).

**Key Concepts:**
- if/elif/else statements
- Integer input with `int()`
- String comparison with `==`
- Basic conditional logic

**Common Pitfall:** Watch the spelling! It's "Sophomore" not "Sophmore" ✓

### 2. 🤯 Snapple Facts (MEDIUM - 10 XP)
**File:** `02_snapple_facts.py`

Learn how to use the `random` module to generate random numbers and use them in conditional statements.

**Key Concepts:**
- Importing modules with `import random`
- Using `random.randint(a, b)` to generate random integers
- Multiple if/elif/else conditions
- Understanding inclusive ranges (0-5 includes both 0 and 5)

**Important:** `randint(a, b)` includes both endpoints! `randint(0, 5)` generates 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, OR 5.

### 3. 🗓️ Seasons of the Year (MEDIUM - 10 XP)
**File:** `03_seasons_of_the_year.py`

Learn how to use logical operators (`or` and `and`) to combine multiple conditions in a single if statement.

**Key Concepts:**
- Logical operators: `or` and `and`
- When to use `or`: Check if ANY condition is true
- When to use `and`: Check if ALL conditions are true
- Combining multiple comparisons with logical operators
- Handling emoji characters in Python strings

**Important:** Use `or` when checking multiple values (month is 1 OR 2 OR 3), not `and`! A month can't be both 1 AND 2 at the same time.

## How to Use This Folder

1. Read the problem description at the top of each file
2. Read through the commented code to understand how it works
3. Run the file with `python filename.py` to see it in action
4. Try modifying the code to understand each part better
5. Check the research notes included in each file for deeper learning

## Progression

- Start with **High School Grades** to learn basic if/elif/else
- Move to **Snapple Facts** to learn about the `random` module and multiple conditions
- Progress to **Seasons of the Year** to master logical operators (`or` and `and`)

Happy learning! 🚀
