# Loops Challenges

Welcome to the Loops section! Here you'll master one of the most powerful concepts in programming: **loops**. Loops allow you to repeat code multiple times without writing it over and over again.

## What Are Loops?

A loop is a block of code that repeats itself based on a condition. Instead of writing the same code 100 times, you can write it once and tell the computer to repeat it 100 times!

There are two main types of loops:
- **while loops**: Repeat while a condition is True
- **for loops**: Repeat a specific number of times or over a collection

## Challenges

### 1. 🚗 Are We There Yet? (MEDIUM - 10 XP)
**File:** `01_are_we_there_yet.py`

Learn the fundamentals of while loops by creating a program that keeps asking "Are we there yet?" until the user answers "Yes".

**Key Concepts:**
- How while loops work and when they run
- Understanding conditions: True and False
- The `!=` operator (not equal to)
- **Critical:** Re-checking conditions after each loop
- Updating variables inside loops (why it's essential!)
- Avoiding infinite loops

**Important Notes:**
- A while loop checks its condition BEFORE each iteration
- The variable inside the loop must be updated, or it will loop forever
- Use `!=` to check "is this NOT equal to that?"

**Common Mistake to Avoid:**
If you don't update the loop variable inside the loop, you'll create an infinite loop that never stops!

## How to Use This Folder

1. Read the problem description at the top of each file
2. Study the detailed comments explaining how loops work
3. Trace through the step-by-step execution examples in the comments
4. Run the file with `python filename.py` and test it
5. Try modifying the code to understand each part better

## Loop Concepts Checklist

As you work through these challenges, make sure you understand:
- [ ] How to write a while loop with proper syntax
- [ ] How conditions work (True/False evaluation)
- [ ] Why you need to initialize a variable before the loop
- [ ] Why you need to update the variable inside the loop
- [ ] How the condition is re-checked after each iteration
- [ ] How to avoid infinite loops
- [ ] The difference between `==` (equal) and `!=` (not equal)
