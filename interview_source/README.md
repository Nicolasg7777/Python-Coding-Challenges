## Tips for Interview Preparation

✅ **Do:**
- Understand concepts deeply, not just memorize
- Practice explaining your thinking out loud
- Analyze your code's complexity before coding
- Think about edge cases
- Test your solutions

❌ **Don't:**
- Memorize solutions without understanding
- Skip the fundamentals
- Assume the interviewer only cares about speed
- Forget to test your code
- Rush through the interview
