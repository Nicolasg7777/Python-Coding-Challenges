## Topics

### 0. Algorithmic Thinking
Foundational concepts for designing and analyzing algorithms.

- **Big O Notation** - Understanding algorithm complexity and efficiency
- **Data Structures** - How data is stored and accessed in memory
- **Logarithms** - How to think about O(log n) operations

### 1. Array and String Manipulation
Practical techniques for working with arrays and strings in interviews.

- **Array** - The fundamental data structure and its performance characteristics
- **Array Slicing** - Understanding the hidden costs of array slicing
- **In-Place Algorithm** - Space vs safety tradeoffs in algorithm design
- **Dynamic Array** - Automatic resizing and amortized analysis

### 2. Hashing and Hash Tables
Building fast data structures using hash functions.

- **Hashing and Hash Functions** - How hashing works and why it's powerful

## Tips for Interview Preparation

✅ **Do:**
- Understand concepts deeply, not just memorize
- Practice explaining your thinking out loud
- Analyze your code's complexity before coding
- Think about edge cases
- Test your solutions

❌ **Don't:**
- Memorize solutions without understanding
- Skip the fundamentals
- Assume the interviewer only cares about speed
- Forget to test your code
- Rush through the interview
