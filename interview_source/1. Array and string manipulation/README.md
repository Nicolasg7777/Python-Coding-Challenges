# 1. Array and String Manipulation

Practical techniques for working with arrays and strings in coding interviews. These are among the most common data structures you'll encounter, and mastering them is essential.

## Readings

### 1. Array
Understanding the fundamentals of arrays and their performance characteristics.

**File:** `array.md`

**Topics Covered:**
- What arrays are and how they work in memory
- Big O complexity for all operations
- Why lookups are fast but inserts/deletes are slow
- How insertion and deletion work
- Why arrays must be contiguous in memory
- Code examples in Java
- Building blocks for other data structures

**Key Concepts:**
- O(1) lookups by index
- O(1) appends (if space available)
- O(n) inserts and deletes (require "scooting over")
- Fixed size limitation
- Memory address calculation
- Contiguity requirement

**The Big Idea:**
Arrays trade flexibility for speed. You get blazing-fast lookups but pay the price for modifications.

## How to Use This Section

1. **Start with Array** - Master the fundamental data structure and its tradeoffs
2. **Work through examples** - Understand why each operation has its complexity
3. **Practice inserting/deleting** - Internalize the cost of modifying arrays
4. **Apply to problems** - Recognize when arrays are the right tool
5. **Compare with alternatives** - Understand why you might choose linked lists instead

## Learning Path

This section will build on your understanding of Big O notation and data structures from the previous section.

Future readings will cover:
- Array slicing and subarrays
- String operations and manipulation
- Two-pointer techniques
- Sliding window patterns
- Common array interview patterns

---

## Pro Tips

- **Visualize it** - Draw out what happens when you insert or delete
- **Think about worst case** - When would insertion/deletion be most expensive?
- **Know the alternatives** - When would you use a linked list instead of an array?
- **Practice the operations** - Mentally trace through a few examples
- **Connect the concepts** - Arrays are the foundation for many other structures
