## Practice Problems

### 1. Merging Meeting Times

**File:** `merging_meeting_times.md`

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Topics:** Array manipulation, sorting, greedy algorithms

**Description:**
Merge overlapping meeting time ranges from a calendar system. Handle edge cases like adjacent meetings and subsumed ranges.

**Key Concepts:**
- Sorting to enable a greedy approach
- Handling overlapping ranges
- Edge cases: adjacent meetings, subsumed meetings, multiple cascading merges
- Time complexity: O(n log n), Space complexity: O(n)

**What You'll Learn:**
- How sorting can transform a problem from O(n²) to O(n log n)
- Greedy algorithms after preprocessing
- Careful edge case handling
- Why in-place solutions might not always be worth it

**Difficulty Progression:**
- **Basic:** Implement the merge function for overlapping ranges
- **Intermediate:** Handle all edge cases correctly
- **Advanced:** Optimize space complexity or discuss in-place approaches

## Interview Preparation Tips

### Before Attempting
- Review the related readings in the Readings section
- Make sure you understand Big O notation and space complexity
- Think about what data structures might be useful

### During Problem Solving
- Read the problem statement carefully at least twice
- Identify all constraints and edge cases
- Start with a brute force approach if you're stuck
- Think about sorting, hashing, or other preprocessing steps
- Consider what tradeoffs you're making (time vs space)

### After Solving
- Verify your solution against all test cases
- Analyze your time and space complexity
- Think about edge cases you might have missed
- Practice explaining your approach out loud
- Consider alternative solutions

## Working with Interview Problems

### Each Problem Includes

1. **Problem Statement** - Clear description of what to solve
2. **Examples** - Input/output examples
3. **Constraints** - What assumptions you can/can't make
4. **Gotchas** - Common mistakes and edge cases to watch for
5. **Approach** - How to think about solving it

8. **Bonus Questions** - Ways to extend or optimize
9. **Test Cases** - Code to verify your solution

### Problem-Solving Strategy

For each problem, follow this process:

1. **Understand** (5 min)
   - Read problem carefully
   - Work through examples
   - Identify edge cases

2. **Brainstorm** (10 min)
   - What approaches come to mind?
   - What data structures could help?
   - What's the brute force solution?

3. **Plan** (5 min)
   - Choose your approach
   - Sketch the algorithm
   - Estimate complexity

4. **Code** (15 min)
   - Write the solution
   - Handle edge cases
   - Keep it clean and readable

5. **Test** (5 min)
   - Run test cases
   - Check edge cases
   - Verify complexity

6. **Optimize** (10 min)
   - Can you improve time complexity?
   - Can you improve space complexity?
   - Is the code clear and maintainable?

## Tips for Success

### General Strategies
- **Start simple** - Get a working solution before optimizing
- **Test early** - Don't wait until you're done to test
- **Think out loud** - Explain your reasoning as you go
- **Handle edge cases** - Explicitly address gotchas
- **Verify complexity** - Make sure your solution meets requirements

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Not reading the problem fully
- Missing edge cases
- Assuming sorted input when it's not
- Forgetting to handle empty inputs
- Creating unnecessary extra space
- Not explaining your approach
